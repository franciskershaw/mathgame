# Love Maths
## Code Institute walkthrough project
This walkthrough project as part of the Code Institute's diploma in full stack software development centered on using vanilla JavaScript functions to produce a basic maths game. Lessons learnt during this project were applied to my second Milestone project, the repository of which can be found [here](https://github.com/franciskershaw/game-of-fives).
